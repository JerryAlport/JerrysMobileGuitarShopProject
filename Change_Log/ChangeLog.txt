     Change, Progress, and Problem Log


15Jan2012  Added Fender.html display and order form for Fender Guitars
    Just Copied Epiphone.html 
    changed images and texts for Fender
    Truncated table for only three currently available Fender images

  Problem with the buy buttons on Fender.html calls a nonexistant
     Javascript function which exists and works fine for Epiphone.html

    First Buy button on ???.html does nothing.  Other buttons work fine.
  First button code copied from other buttons with textual parameter changes only.

19Jan2013 3pm eliminated all  html files marked PC and Mobile.
    All remaining html files are configured for mobile.
    There are copies of the eliminated files on drive H in ADvancedWebDevelopmentFall folder.

19Jan2013 3:30pm On all html pages insured that  in all <a href = tags
  eliminated the target="blank" parameters so that page closed
  and page specific music stopped as we moved to another page.
